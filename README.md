Answers in Ruby for Advent of Code 2022. Likely won't finish all 25 due to celebrating the holidays, but I like doing as many as I can in the first part of the month

In files where the end result is a boolean, like `result == 1234`, it means I found the correct answer and then hardcoded it so I could refactor against it

The `01a.rb` file is the solution for the first half of the puzzle. The `01b.rb` file is a duplicate of the first half's solution, updated with the new requirements for the second part
